The rainfall dashboard, currently in development, can be found [here](https://wprp.shinyapps.io/RainfallDashboard/).  The app queries several APIs that contain data, pulls the last 72 hours for mapping and plotting.  The app also allows the user to query the APIs and download 30-days of data at a time.
